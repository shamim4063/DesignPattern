# The State Pattern
The State pattern is a behavioral pattern that allows an 
object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. 
It is useful when an object needs to change its behavior based 
on its state and when there are multiple states 
that the object can be in.

**The State pattern consists of the following key components:**

**Context:** The context is the object whose behavior changes based on its internal state. 
It maintains a reference to the current state and delegates state-specific behavior to 
the current state object.


**State:** The state is an interface that defines the behavior associated with a particular 
state of the context. 
Each state object implements this interface and provides the context with its behavior when 
it is in that state.

**Concrete states:** Concrete state objects implement the state interface and provide 
the context with behavior specific to a particular state.

**Here is an example of the State pattern:**

```java
interface State {
    void handle(Context context);
}

class ConcreteStateA implements State {
    @Override
    public void handle(Context context) {
        context.setState(new ConcreteStateB());
    }
}

class ConcreteStateB implements State {
    @Override
    public void handle(Context context) {
        context.setState(new ConcreteStateA());
    }
}

class Context {
    private State state;

    public Context() {
        this.state = new ConcreteStateA();
    }

    public void setState(State state) {
        this.state = state;
    }

    public void request() {
        state.handle(this);
    }
}

```

In this example, the State interface defines the behavior of the different states. The ConcreteStateA and ConcreteStateB classes implement this interface and provide the context with behavior specific to their state. The Context class maintains a reference to the current state and delegates state-specific behavior to the current state object. When the request() method is called on the Context object, it calls the handle() method on the current state object, which may change the state of the Context object. The ConcreteStateA and ConcreteStateB classes in this example simply alternate between each other when their handle() method is called.

The State pattern can be used in a variety of situations where an object's behavior needs to change based on its internal state, such as when implementing a vending machine or a game character with different states like "alive" and "dead".
