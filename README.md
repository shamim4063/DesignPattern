# Design Pattern
A design pattern in software development is a reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design.
It is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. 
Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms. 
Design patterns are templates for solving problems that can be adapted to solve new problems.

**There are many design patterns available in software development, but here are some of the most commonly used categories:**

- **Creational patterns:** These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. Examples include the Singleton, Factory Method, and Builder patterns.

- **Structural patterns:** These patterns focus on object composition and provide ways to organize objects to form larger structures. Examples include the Adapter, Bridge, and Decorator patterns.

- **Behavioral patterns:** These patterns are concerned with communication between objects and the delegation of responsibility. Examples include the Observer, Strategy, and Command patterns.

- **Architectural patterns:** These patterns provide high-level guidelines for organizing software systems. Examples include the Model-View-Controller (MVC), Microservices, and Layered Architecture patterns.

- **Concurrency patterns:** These patterns are focused on managing concurrent access to shared resources, such as locks, semaphores, and monitors. Examples include the Mutex, Semaphore, and Read-Write Lock patterns.

These are just a few examples of the different types of design patterns that are available in software development. Each pattern has its own strengths and weaknesses and can be used in different contexts to solve specific problems.

**Here we will discuss some popular design pattern with example code:**

- [**State Pattern**](src/main/java/io/hmshamim/state/STATE.md)
- [**Iterator Pattern**](src/main/java/io/hmshamim/iterator/ITERATOR.md)
- [**Strategy Pattern**](src/main/java/io/hmshamim/strategy/STRATEGY.md)
- [**Template Pattern**](src/main/java/io/hmshamim/template/TEMPLATE.md)
- [**Command Pattern**](src/main/java/io/hmshamim/command/COMMAND.md)
